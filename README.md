# Insurance Portfolio Analytics Dashboard

This project simulates an insurance portfolio and demonstrates **SQL-driven actuarial analytics** with Python visualizations.  
It is designed to showcase practical skills in **SQL, Python (SQLite, pandas, matplotlib)**, and actuarial-style portfolio analysis.

---

## Features
- Built a **relational database** (`Policies`, `Claims`) with 1,000+ mock auto insurance policies and synthetic claim records.
- **Queried key portfolio metrics in SQL**:
  - Loss ratio by car type
  - Age group exposure and claim frequency
  - Top policies by total claim amount
  - Portfolio mix by car type
- Exported SQL query results to **CSV** for reproducibility.
- Integrated results into **Python analytics** with visualizations:
  - Bar chart: Loss ratio by car type
  - Line chart: Average claims per policy by age group
  - Pie chart: Portfolio mix
  - Histogram: Distribution of total claims per policy
  - Scatter: Premium vs total claims (outlier detection)

## Tech Stack
- **SQL**: SQLite database
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- **Database design**: Two-table schema (Policies, Claims)
